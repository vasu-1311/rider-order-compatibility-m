# rider-order-compatibility-m
An end-to-end machine learning backend system that evaluates multiple delivery riders for a given order, computes rider fatigue using workload features, predicts assignment risk using a trained ML model, and recommends the safest rider for assignment. Designed as a decision-support prototype for delivery operations.
